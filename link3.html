<h1> How Dance Affects the Audience</h1>
</span>
Dance has a very powerful way of moving people.
As dancers, we are able to tell a story with our bodies and emotions.
Oftentimes, audience members will feel the connection with the performer, even though they do not know each other personally.
A song can potentially bring back a million memories for someone.
It could be anything from a love song, a favorite song, or a song that reminds them of a difficult time.
Audiences are usually filled with those who have studied dance, as well as those who have not.
Regardless of your dance background, there is definitely a piece that will personally touch your heart.
